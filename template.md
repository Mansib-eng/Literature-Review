**Title**:  
*A Systematic Review on AI-Powered Methods for Assessing Attention and Focus in the Digital Age*

**Abstract**:  
With increasing digital engagement, maintaining user attention is crucial. This study systematically reviews AI-powered methods for attention and focus assessment. Using a PRISMA-guided approach, 45 relevant studies were selected from IEEE, ACM, and Google Scholar. We extracted key details on AI models, datasets, and performance metrics. Results show deep learning, especially CNN and LSTM, dominates recent approaches, with accuracy ranging from 70% to 95% across various datasets (EEG, webcam, and eye-tracking). We identify key research gaps, such as the lack of real-world testing and cross-modal analysis, and suggest directions for future AI applications in attention measurement.

**1. Introduction**  
The digital age has brought a need for understanding user attention in online learning, productivity tools, and mental health monitoring. Traditional methods like surveys and manual observations are time-consuming and subjective. Recently, AI has enabled automated, real-time attention analysis using physiological and behavioral data. However, no comprehensive review exists on these AI-driven techniques.  
**Research Questions:**  
- What AI methods are being used to measure attention and focus?  
- What datasets and metrics are commonly used?  
- What are the limitations of current approaches?  
- What are the gaps and future directions in this domain?

**2. Methodology**  
We followed the PRISMA framework for systematic review.  
**Databases:** IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar  
**Keywords:** ("attention detection" OR "focus detection") AND ("AI" OR "machine learning")  
**Inclusion Criteria:** Peer-reviewed papers from 2015–2024, using AI for attention detection  
**Exclusion Criteria:** Non-English papers, surveys, and studies without implementation  
**Selection Process:**  
- Records identified: 155  
- After screening titles/abstracts: 78  
- Final selected studies after full-text review: 45  
**Data Extraction:** We created a table noting the model, dataset, metrics, findings, and limitations for each study.

**3. Results**  
Among the 45 papers:  
- **Models Used:** 28 used deep learning (CNN, LSTM), 10 used classical ML (SVM, RF), and 7 used hybrid models.  
- **Data Sources:** 15 EEG, 10 webcam/video, 8 eye-tracking, 12 used multi-modal signals  
- **Performance:** Accuracy ranged from 70% to 95%, with deep learning models performing better overall.  

**Data Table Sample:**  

| Author | Year | Model | Dataset | Metric | Result | Limitation |  
|--------|------|--------|---------|--------|--------|------------|  
| Lee et al. | 2021 | CNN + LSTM | Webcam video | Accuracy | 89% | Limited real-world test |  
| Ahmed et al. | 2023 | SVM | EEG signals | F1 Score | 0.76 | Small sample size |  

**4. Discussion**  
Deep learning models perform well, but require large annotated datasets. Real-time systems are still rare. Multimodal approaches (e.g., combining EEG and webcam) show promise. However, hardware requirements and ethical concerns about privacy remain unaddressed in most papers.

**5. Conclusion and Future Work**  
AI methods for attention detection have made progress, but face challenges in deployment, fairness, and scalability. Future work should focus on lightweight models, ethical design, and real-world validation.

### **How to Keep Track While Reading Papers**

Here’s what to do while reading:

**Create a Tracking Sheet (Spreadsheet or Notion Table):**  
Include these columns:  
- Paper Title  
- Author(s)  
- Year  
- AI Model Used  
- Dataset  
- Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, etc.)  
- Main Findings  
- Limitations  
- Relevance to Your RQs (1–5 rating)

**Write Short Notes:**  
Use your own words to summarize the paper’s contribution, not just copy the abstract.

**Color Code or Tag:**  
Mark papers by model type (DL, ML, Hybrid), or dataset (EEG, webcam, etc.) for easier synthesis later.

**Zotero/Mendeley Tip:**  
Use tags and notes in citation tools so you don’t lose context when exporting references.
