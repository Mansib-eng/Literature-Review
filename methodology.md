You **do not need to study hundreds of papers in full**. Instead, follow a **systematic and selective approach** to extract information efficiently. That’s the power of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Here's how to do it smartly:

### 1. **Initial Search and Filtering**
You'll usually start with **100–200 papers** from your search using keywords across databases like IEEE, ACM, Springer, ScienceDirect, or Google Scholar.

Then apply **inclusion/exclusion criteria** to reduce it to around **30–60 highly relevant papers**. These criteria can be:
- Publication year (e.g., only 2015–2024)
- Relevance to your research questions
- Peer-reviewed only
- Language: English
- Full text available

### 2. **Title + Abstract Screening**
Don’t read full papers initially. Do this:
- Read **title and abstract**
- Check for relevance to your **research questions**
- Mark as “Include”, “Exclude”, or “Maybe”

### 3. **Use PRISMA Framework**
This helps track how many papers were found, filtered, included/excluded, and the final set selected.

### 4. **Information Extraction Techniques**
When reading the **selected papers (around 30–50)**, focus on extracting only what you need:
- What **AI/ML model** they used?
- What **dataset** did they apply it on?
- What were their **metrics/results**?
- What were the **limitations or challenges** mentioned?

You can even skim through:
- **Introduction** for problem definition
- **Methodology** to know models/datasets
- **Results/Discussion** to find outcomes
- **Conclusion** for insights/gaps/future work

### 5. **Tools to Help You**
- Use **Zotero** or **Mendeley** to manage papers and take notes
- Use a **summary sheet or table** (can be in Excel or Notion) for each paper you include
- Optionally, you can use **AI tools** (like Elicit.org or Semantic Scholar) to get quick summaries and extract key points

**Goal:** Instead of deeply studying 100+ papers, you're strategically identifying and extracting core data from **30 to 50 highly relevant** papers.
