1. **Log search terms** and associate them with found papers  
2. **Track how many papers were found per search term**  
3. **Document the PRISMA flow** steps  
4. **Record exclusion reasons and paper counts at each stage**  
5. **End up with a final list of selected papers**

For **all-in-one SLR management with PRISMA tracking**, your best option is:

### **Rayyan** (https://rayyan.ai)

**Why Rayyan is perfect for you:**

- Lets you **add search terms**, **source**, and **paper metadata** (title, abstract, etc.)
- You can import papers via **BibTeX**, **RIS**, **EndNote**, or **manually**
- You can **tag papers** with custom labels (like search term used, inclusion/exclusion reasons)
- **Blinding feature** to reduce bias when screening (optional)
- Fully supports **inclusion/exclusion tagging**
- You can **filter papers** based on reasons and generate PRISMA stats
- It shows you how many papers are at each stage: **found, included, excluded**
- You can **export final lists** and PRISMA tracking

Rayyan is widely used in academic SLRs and health/clinical reviews because it aligns very well with PRISMA standards. While it doesn’t auto-generate a PRISMA diagram, you can **easily copy the counts and reasons** to tools like the [PRISMA flowchart generator](https://prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/FlowDiagram.aspx).

If you want to keep your data 100% in your control and offline, then a close alternative is:

### **Excel or Google Sheets Template (Custom-Built)**

You could build a tracker with:

- One tab for **search log** (term, date, number of papers, database used)
- One tab for **paper list with inclusion/exclusion tagging**
- One tab for **PRISMA step logging** (with formulas to auto-calculate numbers at each stage)

But this requires manual effort to design.

So in short:  
**Use Rayyan** — it’s the best fit for your workflow, all-in-one, and designed exactly for this purpose. Want help setting up your Rayyan project structure?
