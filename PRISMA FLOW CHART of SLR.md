1. **Log search terms** and associate them with found papers  
2. **Track how many papers were found per search term**  
3. **Document the PRISMA flow** steps  
4. **Record exclusion reasons and paper counts at each stage**  
5. **End up with a final list of selected papers**

### **PRISMA Flow Diagram Table (Text Format)**

| Phase                     | Number of Papers | Description |
|---------------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Records identified        | 185              | Retrieved from IEEE Xplore (60), ACM DL (45), Springer (30), Google Scholar (50) using keywords like "attention detection AI", "focus tracking machine learning" etc. |
| Records after duplicates removed | 160        | Removed 25 duplicates using reference manager (e.g., Zotero/Mendeley) |
| Records screened (Title + Abstract) | 160     | Reviewed title and abstract to see if relevant to the research questions |
| Records excluded          | 95               | Not related to AI methods or didn't focus on attention/focus assessment |
| Full-text articles assessed | 65              | Downloaded and fully reviewed to evaluate methodologies and results |
| Full-text articles excluded | 20             | Rejected because of poor methodology, irrelevant focus, or insufficient technical detail |
| Studies included in final synthesis | 45      | Final set of peer-reviewed, relevant studies used in data extraction and analysis |

If you want to visualize this, I can also turn this into a proper **PRISMA flowchart image**, like the one typically shown in published SLR papers.

Would you like that version too?
